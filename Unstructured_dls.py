    A class for loading unstructured data from files within a specified directory structure.
    
    This loader is specifically designed to work within a predefined folder hierarchy, where
    the base directory ('unstructured_data') contains subdirectories corresponding to different
    categories of unstructured data (e.g., 'art', 'history'). Each subdirectory may contain multiple
    text files, from which data can be loaded individually or in bulk.

        Initializes the data loader by setting up the base path to the 'unstructured_data' folder.
        
        The base path is constructed relative to the location of this script, allowing for flexible
        use across different environments without needing to hard-code the absolute path.
